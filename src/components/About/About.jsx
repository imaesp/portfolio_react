          <motion.h1 variants={textVariants}>
          From a young age, I was captivated by the process of building my own toys, fascinated by how I could bring something entirely new into existence with just my hands and imagination. 
          This early obsession naturally evolved into a passion for software engineering and web development. 
          </motion.h1>
          <motion.h1>
          Now, as a Computer Science student at Brooklyn College, I'm driven by the same desire to create and innovateâ€”only now, 
          I'm building software instead of toys. My aspiration to become a Full Stack Web Developer is fueled by this lifelong love of building, 
          as I continue to develop my skills in both front-end and back-end development, eager to construct the digital solutions of tomorrow.
